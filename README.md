# Mad_Libs_Anything
Input a peice of text, and get it back in mad libs form!

This is a pretty simple little program I wrote because I wanted to learn about NLP libraries. I wrote it about a year ago, and it was just languishing in my repl.it account, so I thought I'd put it up on github in case anyone was interested.
